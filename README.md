See also erode.sh (companion script).
Get started

First, clone this repository (you need the git command installed) from a terminal window:

git clone https://github.com/sensamillion/erode.git .esanin

This creates a new hidden folder named ".iggy" in your home directory.

Please copy the file "iggy.sh" from this new folder to the download folder.

Now change to the download folder and make the script executable:

chmod +x iggy.sh

Then issue the following command:

./iggy.sh

On subsequent runs, open a terminal and simply type:

iggy.sh

(Use tab completion: Just type igg and press Tab)
Update local repository

Be sure to check for updates at least once a week. In order to do this, change to ~/.iggy/ and run:

git pull

That's it.
